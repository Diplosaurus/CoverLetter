# CoverLetter
A small python script that enables a user to populate a date and recipient field in a cover letter template.  
Must have a template to use.  

To Use:
1. Make sure you install dependencies
  - shutil
  - datetime
  - docx
2. Add a [DATE] and [RECIPIENT] identifier where you want there to be a date and recipient.  

To Run:
  - python(3) cover_letter.py "[YOUR RECIPIENT HERE]" or,
  - ./cover_letter.py "[YOUR_RECIPIENT HERE]"
  
(More functionality to be added soon!)
